## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Single hosted SPA in React with React helmet

- The developer onboarding time is better on an SPA as there is no separations between server side rendered code and dynamically fed UI to handle
- An SPA is much more similar to a react native mobile application as it as all its content served empty and fetches the data dynamically

### NextJS server side rendering solution for React

- The performances offered by server side rendering is more optimisable than with SPA as some pages can be rendered statically and caching can be applied to data & layout
- The PWA integration in Next is coming out of the box
- The SEO is assured as all the pages are rendered on the server side and is compatible with google referencement crawlers. Helmet could provide this as well but requires specific configuration on each page
- Some of the product complexity (such as routing) is handled automatically by the framework and retrieve the complications of handling complexe navigation front side

=> Considering the criticality of SEO, performance and PWA integration for this project, this is the solution we retained.
