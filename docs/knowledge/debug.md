## Debug mode

In order to launch your server in debug mode, you can execute

```bash
yarn debug
```

After this, you can hit the Debugging tab of VS Code and run "Launch Program" to attach the debugger to the current inspect node session.

Once you are done, the code execution will stop on every "debugger;" statement in your code and every breakpoint you setup via VS Code
