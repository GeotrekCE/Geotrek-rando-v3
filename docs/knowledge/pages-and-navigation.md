# Pages and navigation

In Next, whenever a file is created into the `src/pages` folder, the server consider it as a "page" and will automatically handle routing.

Therefore, you can navigate from a page to another by hreferencing its route, this will trigger "server side" navigation.

You can also use the "Link" component from next, in order to perform a "client side" navigation.
