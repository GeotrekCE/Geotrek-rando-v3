**⚠️ Version notes**

If you update Geotrek-rando v3, the global Docker process has been updated to avoid the Docker image build on your server :

* Download the version 2.0.0 of [Geotrek-rando-installer](https://github.com/GeotrekCE/Geotrek-rando-v3-installer) 
(``wget https://github.com/GeotrekCE/Geotrek-rando-v3-installer/archive/v2.0.0.zip``) and unzip it in a new folder
* Rapatriate your customization in this folder, overriding the default one
* Eventually create and update the ``.env`` file to define another port from the 8080 default one
* Make sure your NGINX configuration uses the same port (8080 by default)
* Install Docker Compose. See its [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Launch the application with ``docker-compose up -d``
* No need anymore to build a Docker image on your server to install or update the configuration of your Geotrek-rando
* Details in [installation documentation](/docs/installation.md)
* You can also remove your previous Docker containers and images with launching ``docker container prune`` and ``docker image prune -a``
